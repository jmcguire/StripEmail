Then how do you explain the article in Hebrew I referred you to? Furthermore, back before I had started reading Larry Wall's "Perl, the First Post-Modern Language" I recall also having bad associations with the word "post-Modern" 
(though they were founded on a feeling rather than actually knowing what post- modern really meant.).

I can attest that tzafrir_laptop ( see: http://tzafrir.org.il/ ) was not being paranoid or nitpicky and is a trustworthy person, despite some of his faults.
