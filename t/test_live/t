i recommend the o'reilly school of technology. they just added a perl course (level 1 only so far). i know the author well and it the school is considered very good in how it teaches the classes. i don't know your budget but those courses you listed are expensive. and you won't get a top level teacher from a mass marketed class like that.  they will cram too much into such a short period that you won't learn much.

just looking at the topics page i see many errors already. that bodes poorly for the classes.
