I think the developers of Perl 6 would do everybody a big favor by renaming 
it.   Calling it Perl 6 implies something that increasingly doesn't seem to 
be true, and inhibits interest in and active development of Perl 5.

I realize that Perl 6, both from a language design and internal
architecture perspective, was always intended to be a ground-up redesign.

However, the ideals of a plan and the practical reality don't always
match up. There isn't exactly a production-ready Perl 6, or even
anything close to it, to make the case that a pure Perl 6 is a viable
alternative to evolving Perl 5.

I'd rather see the products of the Perl 6 "blue sky" design end up being
incorporated into Perl 5, than to have those ideas effectively shelved
waiting for a Perl 6 platform that may never adequately materialize.

That may not be the primary goal, but it seems to be what is happening
for the past few releases.
