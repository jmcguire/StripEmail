It's probably better to have one array anyway:

    my @uploads =
        grep defined $_->{obj},
        map  +{
            name    => $_,
            obj     => $query->{uploads}{$_},
        },
        map  $query->param("filepath$_"),
        "", 1..9;

Unwrapping that into two arrays (if that's really necessary) is then
just a matter of

    my @filenames   = map $_->{name}, @uploads;
    my @upload_objs = map $_->{obj}, @uploads;
