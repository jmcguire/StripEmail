The Excel scheme is nowhere as clean as you think it is, because there is no
_single_ Excel scheme. There are two epochs, one is the buggy 1900 epoch,
the other is the 1904 epoch. In addition, there's an "extended" date format,
which doesn't handle the Julian -> Gregorian transition very well.

You'd be hard pressed to find a worse example of how to handle dates than
Excel.
