nope. not by a long shot. it doesn't say anything about paths which has
been a part of this thread. a bulletproof requirements and spec is a lot
harder than you realize. it is effectly defining the results you want
with all possible data issues taken into consideration. what if a newer
version by date is actually an empty file? there are so many little nits
to deal with in even the seemingly smallest problems. this is called
analysis and why early programming jobs were called data analysts. i
wish that title was in use again as it is one of the most important and
ignore part of programming jobs.
