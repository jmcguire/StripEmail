DESCRIPTION
       This software will remove quoted replies, signatures, and branding
       lines from an email.  (This functionality works similarly to how Google
       hides quoted replies in Groups and Gmail.)  If you want to only hide
       one of those nuisances, import just the relevant function.  The
       available functions are:

           strip_email              <-- imported by default
           strip_email_quotedreply
           strip_email_signature
           strip_email_branding

       Each function takes in one string as an argument, which should be the
       body of the email.

       Each function returns the modified email.  If it doesn't modify
       anything, then it will just return the original email.

   strip_email( $email )
       strip_email basically just executes these three in turn:

           strip_email_signature
           strip_email_branding
           strip_email_quotedreply

       It will return any stripped email it comes up with.  It tries stripping
       everything, but if that doesn't work, then it tries stripping just the
       signature and branding.

   strip_email_quotedreply( $email )
       strip_email_quotedreply will only strip out a quoted reply.  It
       attempts to guess at where an email begins and what quote marks, if
       any, are used.

       If we find that the sender broke the quoted reply into parts and put
       comments in between each part, we won't strip anything out.  However,
       we do try to distinguish between original comments and bad word
       wrapping, where a word of a quoted email appears on its own line
       accidentally.

   strip_email_signature( $email )
       strip_email_signature strips the signature.  It simply looks for the
       last line we see with just a "--" mark, and cuts everything below it.

   strip_email_branding( $email )
       strip_email_branding strips the email branding signature that comes
       from mobile devices.  It looks like this:

           "Sent from my BlackBerry"

       We will only strip one of these, the last one we see.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "We found a quoted line, but then were unable to find it again."

       This should never be encountered, as it indicates a program bug.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Given the vast number of non-standard reply and signature semantics,
       Email::StripEmail makes a few guesses and assumptions.  These guess and
        assumptions leaf to logic errors come in two varieties.

        1) In some cases, emails will not have a quoted reply stripped out that should
           have been.
        2) More troublesome, and hopefully more rare, sometimes a reply is stripped
           that includes non-reply information.
